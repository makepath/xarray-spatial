    "Similar to zonal statistics, focal statistics are used to calculate local statistics, but relative to a _focal_ point and a given neighborhood. The neighborhood is a user-defined kernel representing the cells which should be used in calculations. Currently, only circle and annulus kernels are implemented, but any custom kernel can be used given that:\n",
    "- The kernel is a `numpy` array\n",

    "The following example uses focal statistics to calculate the [topographic position index (TPI)](http://www.jennessent.com/downloads/tpi-poster-tnc_18x22.pdf), a measure of local topographic position relative to nearby neighbors. The TPI is scale-dependent and will vary based on the inner and outer radii chosen for the annulus kernel used for this calculation. Once calculated, the TPI can be used to classify slope positions and landforms within landscapes, and can also be used as a numeric feature for model inputs."
