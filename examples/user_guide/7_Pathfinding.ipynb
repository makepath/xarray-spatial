    "A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (min distance travelled, shortest time, ...). \n",

    "The `xrspatial.a_star_search` function calculates the shortest path in pixel space from a start location to a goal location through a given aggregate surface graph. The graph should be a line raster which contains crossable and non-crossable (a.k.a walls or barrieres) values. Note that both start and goal are in (lon, lat), or (x, y) coordinate space and must be within the graph. `xrspatial.a_star_search` provides 2 separate options, `snap_start` and `snap_goal`, which can be set to true to snap locations to the nearest valid value before beginning pathfinding. It also provides a `connectivity` option to indicate neighborhood structure. This value can be set to 4 or 8 for 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity."
