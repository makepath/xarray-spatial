Currently, only circle and annulus kernels are implemented, but any custom kernel can be used given that:\n",

The TPI is scale-dependent and will vary based on the inner and outer radii chosen for the annulus kernel used for this calculation. Once calculated, the TPI can be used to classify slope positions and landforms within landscapes, and can also be used as a numeric feature for model inputs."
