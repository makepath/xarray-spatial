    "\n",
    "Similar to zonal statistics, focal statistics are also used to calculate statistics locally, but relative to a _focal_ point and a neighborhood around that rather than an inflexible zone. The neighborhood is defined with a kernel representing the neighboring cells which should be used in the calculations for each cell. Currently, only circle and annulus kernels are implemented, but any custom kernel can be used, as long as:\n",
    "- The kernel is a `numpy` array\n",

The TPI is scale-dependent and will vary based on the relative sizes of the inner and outer radii in the annulus kernel used, so one TPI does not define *all* TPIs. Once calculated, a TPI can be used to classify slope positions and landforms within landscapes, and can also be used as a numeric feature for model inputs."
