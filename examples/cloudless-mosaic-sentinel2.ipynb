    "# Mosaic from a single multitemporal dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to provide an example of how to create a cloud-free mosaic from Sentinel-2 imagery over a specific area over a period of time. First, we use `satsearch` to search for Sentinel-2 data, then we combine the returned images using `stackstac`. Finally, a median operation is applied to merge the images into a single layer that can be saved as COGs in Azure blob storage for later use.\n",

    "Satellite images (also Earth observation imagery, spaceborne photography, or simply satellite photos) are images of Earth collected by imaging satellites typically operated by governments and businesses around the world (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_imagery). Major applications include Earth observation and land-cover monitoring. \n",
