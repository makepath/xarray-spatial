    "The goal of this notebook is to provide an example of how to create a cloud-free mosaic from Sentinel-2 imagery over a specific area over a time period. We first use `satsearch` to search for Sentinel-2 data then combine them together using `stackstac`. A median operation will be applied to merge the images into a single layer that could be save off into Azure blob storage as COGs for later use.\n",
